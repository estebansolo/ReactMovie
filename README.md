# ReactMovie

This is a resposive Movie Web App with ReactJS in a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-react-the-fun-way/). It uses [The movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to display information.
<br />
I also include what I learned in the [PWA Course](https://platzi.com/clases/pwa-react-js/)

## What I Learned

  - PWA
  - Sass
  - Hooks
  - Service Workers
  - Stateless and Stateful components
  - I better understood the use of different ReactJS themes

## Scripts

  - `npm install` to install dependencies
  - `npm start` for Development environment
  - `npm run serve` for Production environment
