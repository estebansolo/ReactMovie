# ReactMovie

This is a resposive Movie Web App with ReactJS in a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-react-the-fun-way/).
<br />
It uses [The movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to display information.

## What I Learned

  - Hooks
  - Redux
  - Stateless and Stateful components
  - I better understood the use of different ReactJS themes
